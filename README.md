1. The AI implementation

Libraries used : easyAI, numpy

    - EsayAI is a pure-Python artificial intelligence framework for two players games. This 
    library makes it easy to define the mechanism of a game and, in our case, play it against 
    the computer. Under the hood, the AI is a NegaMax algorithm with alpha-beta prunning.

    - Numpy is a python library generally used to create array objects, we thought that by using numpy 
    we would easely have access to the different positions on the board and we could easely go through it 
    to collect information for the AI.
